    "\n",
    "Reusability: Functions allow you to write a block of code once and reuse it multiple times throughout your program. \n",
    "This saves time and effort, and also reduces the amount of code you need to write and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Functions help to break a program into smaller, more manageable pieces. \n",
    "This makes it easier to understand and maintain complex code, \n",
    "and also allows multiple programmers to work on different parts of the program simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Functions allow you to hide the details of a particular operation and focus on its functionality instead. \n",
    "This makes code easier to read and understand, \n",
    "and also makes it easier to change the underlying implementation without affecting the rest of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing: Functions make it easier to test individual parts of a program in isolation, \n",
    "which can help to identify and fix bugs more quickly and easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code organization: Functions help to organize code into logical units, \n",
    "making it easier to navigate and understand. \n",
    "This can be especially helpful in larger programs where code can quickly become difficult to manage.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Overall, functions are an essential tool for building modular, reusable, \n",
    "and maintainable programs. They allow you to write code that is more efficient, \n",
    "easier to read and maintain, and less prone to errors\n",
